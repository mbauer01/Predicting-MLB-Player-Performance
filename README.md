The project revolves around analyzing batting records of Major League baseball players over a single season to estimate their latent ability and predict performance using Bayesian methods. Inspired by Brown's (2008) paper on in-season prediction of batting averages, the project involves several tasks:

  1. Data preprocessing: Exclude players with insufficient at-bats (AB) in either period and calculate the remaining players.
  2. Bayesian estimation: Develop a Bayesian method to estimate players' latent ability based on their data in the first period.
  3. Hierarchical modeling: Construct a Bayesian hierarchical model for transformed variables to estimate player abilities.
  4. Performance prediction: Estimate batting performance for the second period based on Bayesian estimates from the first period.
  5. Evaluation: Compare the mean squared error (MSE) of different estimators to assess prediction accuracy.
  6. Subgroup analysis: Perform separate analyses for non-pitchers and pitchers, comparing MSEs between groups.

The project aims to provide insights into the predictive power of Bayesian methods in assessing player performance in baseball, drawing on statistical modeling and data analysis techniques.
